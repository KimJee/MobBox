* [x] Copy and paste Tutorial 1 
* [ ] Get Video Recording from Malmo

    * The link above showed me how to finally get the MP4. Can't believe I that this took me 2 hours. You would think that if you set the function to record it would do this,
        but you have to get the world to show their video. That's some BS.
Documentation that might be handy
i
* [x] Rearranging desk to have a second monitor if it can even fit ;|

* [ ] Splice those videos into frames
