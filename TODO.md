## Todo for 1/29/2021

* [x] Copy and paste Tutorial 1
* [x] Get Video Recording from Malmo
  * This [link](https://elbruno.com/2017/11/09/vs2017-minecraft-game-interaction-agents-missions-definitions-and-recording-with-projectmalmo/) showed me how to finally get the MP4. Can't believe I that this took me 3 long hours. You would think that Malmo would have a much better interface, and that one call to 'recordMP4' would be the *only* thing it needs to show the video. But you have to call another function (getVideo) to show their video. That's some BS.
  * Also, I wish there was much better documentation. This is such a horrible framework and the some of the critical links are DEAD!
* [x] Rearranging desk to have a second monitor if it can even fit ;|
* [ ] Splice those videos into frames
  * Apparently FFMPEG has a video to image splitting functionality so I'm going to give that a shot.

## Todo as a Group

* [ ] Run it through a 'differentiator
