**A pre-trained convolutional neural networked designed to see mobs in Minecraft!**

## From this, to this!

![Colormap Chicken](img/image2.png "Diagram for Proposal")
![Colormap Chicken](img/image3.png "Diagram for Proposal")

We grab the two images.

![IOU Box](img/image1.png "Diagram for Proposal")

We then train the model using the intersection-over-union metric.
Then after some training...

![Final Bounding Box](img/image6.png "Diagram for Proposal")

We create model that can detect where the mob is on the screen.
