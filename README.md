# Idea List

## Games recreated in Minecraft

- Wumpus World in Minecraft

  - Not very good idea because of COMBAT + MAZE
  - Done multiple times by other groups

- Checkers in Minecraft

  - Not good because it doens't really use minecraft/malmo

- Crafter

  - Given a inventory of stuff, the objective is to create a certain item
  - INPUT: wood block and 2 stones
  - OUTPUT: crafted sword
  - Constraint Satisfaction Problem

- Minecraft Traveler

  - GOAL: To reach a certain biome in minecraft
  - CONS: Long Training times

- Minecraft Forager

  - GOAL: Tries to find a certain item in minecraft

- Minecraft: Promethius
  - GOAL: Create fire
    - IDK how to incoorporate ML/AI to this
- Minecraft Farmer:

  - GOAL: create food to eat
    - IDK how to incoorporate ML/AI to this

- Minecraft Bridge Builder:
  Goal: Looks for two highest hills, and builds a bridge accross?

- Scavanger Hunt Agent

  - We pre-generate a map (with the items built-in)
  - The agent has to to collect the items in the scavanger hunt
  - Navigate to the next item
  - Repeat until the list is done

- Explorer of the Islands

  - [ ] Generate a map with only ocean
    - i = number of islands
  - [ ] For every island Randomly create small circle on this map
    - h = number of hills
  - [ ] And for each island generate h hills
  - [ ] On the highest hill, put a treasure chest at the top

  - [ ] GOAL: Agents has to find the treasure chest at the top of the hill
  - [ ] It has to explore different islands (using ML to gauge distance and height)
    - [depth is also given by malmo's source code]
  - [ ] It then has to find the highest hill on the island
    - Then go to the highest hill to see if there's a treasure chest
    - If treasure found (done)
    - Otherwise explore a different island

- Minecraft Agario:
- [ ] Maybe we can make Agar.io in minecraft, with multiple agents trying to get as much pellets as possible.

  - [ ] Use ML to optimize pellets for a given map

- [ ] Minecraft SpleefAI
  - Goal: try to survive as long as possible when we slowly start deleting blocks fron under the agent.

Spleef[edit]
Main article:Â Spleef
Spleef is a popular minigame where players attempt to break blocks under their opponents in order to cause them to fall. The game takes place on a map made of 1 block thick layers often made of snow since it can be broken quickly. Multiple layers are often used to allow players to fall multiple times without losing. The objective is to be the last player or team standing. PvP is normally disabled to ensure players are not punched off the map. Most spleef games have a method to allow players to break blocks from a distance, such as snowballs that break blocks.

And we can make the AI try to live as long as possible, and pit the AI against other AIs.
