# Idea List

## Games recreated in Minecraft
* Wumpus World in Minecraft
    * Not very good idea because of COMBAT + MAZE

* Checkers in Minecraft
    * Not good because it doens't really use minecraft/malmo

* Crafter
    * Given a inventory of stuff, the objective is to create a certain item
    * INPUT: wood block and 2 stones
    * OUTPUT: crafted sword

* Minecraft Traveler
    * GOAL: To reach a certain biome in minecraft

* Minecraft Forager

* Minecraft: Promethius
    * GOAL: Create fire

* Scavanger Hunt Agent
    * We pregenerate a map
    * The agent has to to collevt the items in the scavanger
    * Navigate to the next item
    * Repeat until the list is done

* Explorer of the Islands
    - [ ] Generate a map with only ocean
        - i = number of islands
    - [ ] For every island Randomly create small circle on this map
        - h = number of hills
    - [ ] And for each island generate h hills
    - [ ] On the highest hill, put a treasure chest at the top

    - [ ] GOAL: Agents has to find the treasure chest at the top of the hill
    - [ ] It has to explore different islands (using ML to gauge distance and height) 
        * [depth is also given by malmo's source code]
    - [ ] It then has to find the highest hill on the island
        - Then go to the highest hill to see if there's a treasure chest
        - If treasure found (done)
        - Otherwise explore a different island
